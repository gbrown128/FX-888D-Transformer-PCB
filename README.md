# FX-888D-Transformer-PCB
A replacement design for the FX-888D mains input transformer PCB.

At the time of writing I have 4 spare boards manufactured. Drop me a message and I'll happily post one out!

Please note I have not verified that this board design passes any specific safety standard. The safety of the design will vary with the quality of PCB substrate used.

This design fits the 120 V unit I have, with a manufacturing date of July 2017. Hakko only seem to offer only one kind of replacement, so I suspect this design will fit all units.

If you have a 240V variant it would be great to add the details about the MOV used. Please submit an issue and I'll update the tables to suit!

I used the larger alternative MOV as the 5 mm disk was out of stock. To my knowledge the larger size just makes for a more robust device.
